# C++ with OOPS – Core Concepts

## 📌 Overview

**C++ with Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** is a powerful programming approach that focuses on organizing code using objects and classes. OOPS helps in building **modular, reusable, secure, and scalable applications** by modeling real-world entities in software.

C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, making it one of the most versatile languages in computer science.

## 🧠 What is OOPS?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) is a paradigm that structures programs around **objects**, which combine data and functions into a single unit called a **class**.

Instead of focusing only on functions, OOPS emphasizes:

* Data security
* Code reusability
* Real-world modeling
* Better program structure

# 🧩 Core Concepts of OOPS in C++

---

## 1️⃣ Class

A **class** is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines data members (variables) and member functions (methods).

### 🔧 Basic Syntax

```
class ClassName {
    access_specifier:
        data_members;
        member_functions;
};
```

---

## 2️⃣ Object

An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and occupies memory when created.

### 🔧 Basic Syntax

```
ClassName objectName;
```

---

## 3️⃣ Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of **wrapping data and functions together** into a single unit (class). It protects data from unauthorized access using access specifiers.

### 🔹 Access Specifiers

* `public` – Accessible from anywhere
* `private` – Accessible only within the class
* `protected` – Accessible within class and derived classes

---

## 4️⃣ Abstraction

Abstraction hides internal implementation details and shows only essential features to the user. It reduces complexity and increases efficiency.

---

## 5️⃣ Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and behavior from another class. It promotes **code reusability**.

### 🔧 Basic Syntax

```
class DerivedClass : access_specifier BaseClass {
};
```

---

## 6️⃣ Polymorphism

Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows the same function or operator to behave differently in different situations.

### 🔹 Types of Polymorphism

* Compile-time (Function Overloading, Operator Overloading)
* Run-time (Function Overriding using Virtual Functions)

---

## 7️⃣ Constructors and Destructors

* **Constructor**: Special function used to initialize objects
* **Destructor**: Special function used to clean up resources when an object is destroyed

---

## 🎯 Advantages of OOPS in C++

* Improved code reusability
* Better data security
* Easier maintenance
* Real-world modeling
* Modular program structure

---

## 📚 Exam-Oriented Definition

> Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) in C++ is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects to design software, emphasizing encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

C++ with OOPS core concepts provides a structured and efficient way to design programs. By understanding and applying these principles, developers can create robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
